\problemname{A Different Problem}

Write a program that computes the difference between non-negative integers.

\subsection*{Input}

Each line of the input consists of a pair of integers $a$, $b$.
The input is terminated by end of file.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $0 \leq a, b \leq 10^{15}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output}

For each pair of integers in the input, output one line, containing the absolute value of their difference.
